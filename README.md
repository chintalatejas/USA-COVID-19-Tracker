# USA COVID-19 Tracker

This notebook utilized the Structured Streaming Spark SQL engine to create a weekly tracker for monitoring COVID-19 cases and deaths across the different USA states and counties, with the seamless integration of sliding and tumbling window operations to ensure real-time and comprehensive data analysis, enhancing the precision and granularity of our insights into the evolving pandemic landscape at the regional level.
